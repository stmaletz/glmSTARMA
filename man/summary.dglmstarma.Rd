\description{
This functions summarizes the model fit of a dglmstarma model.
}
\details{
Standard errors, z-values and p-values are computed assuming asymptotic normality of the parameter estimation. The variance estimation is based on the sandwich estimator to adjust for quasi-maximum-likelihood estimation.
If the model requires non-negative parameters, the p-values are adjusted accordingly. Note that this adjustment is only valid for testing single parameters against the null hypothesis of being zero.
If multiple parameters are tested simultaneously, or a linear combination of them, a different adjustment is necessary.

If the dispersion model is constant, i.e. it is only an intercept model, a test is performed to test whether the estimated dispersion parameter is significantly different from the null hypothesis value \code{phi}.
The alternative hypothesis can be specified via the \code{alternative} argument. This can be useful to test for overdispersion or underdispersion in the data.
