\description{
Multivariate time series containing monthly sea surface temperature anomalies in the Pacific
}
\details{
This dataset contains monthly sea surface temperature anomalies (in degree Celsius) at 25 spatial locations in the Pacific Ocean over a time period of 33 years (396 months) from January 1970 to December 2002.

The neighborhood matrices in the list \code{W_directed} for orders 2, 3, 4, and 5 correspond to neighbors with the location directly north, east, south, and west.
Coefficients estimated using these matrices then reflect directed dependencies.
Not all neighbors always exist at boundary locations of the observed area.
In these cases, the corresponding rows of the weight matrices contain only zeros.
These matrices are stored as objects of class 'dgCMatrix' from the 'Matrix' R package.

The dataset is not included directly in the package. See the examples how to load it using the \code{load_data} function.
